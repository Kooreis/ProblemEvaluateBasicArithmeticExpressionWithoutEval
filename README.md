# Question: How do you evaluate a basic arithmetic expression without using eval? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a console application that evaluates a basic arithmetic expression without using the eval function. It uses the readline module to interact with the user through the console, asking them to input an arithmetic expression. The code then identifies the operator in the expression using a regular expression and splits the input string into operands using the identified operator. The operands are then converted into numbers. The code uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator. If the operator is a division symbol and the second operand is zero, the code prints an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed and then terminates the program. If the operation is valid, the result is calculated and printed to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. It uses a class-based approach and the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to evaluate the arithmetic expression. 

In the TypeScript version, a Calculator class is defined with a private property 'operators' which is an object that maps each operator to a function that performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The Calculator class also has a public method 'evaluate' that takes an arithmetic expression in RPN as input and returns the result of the expression.

The 'evaluate' method splits the expression into tokens and processes each token. If the token is an operator, it pops two numbers from the stack, performs the operation using the function mapped to the operator in the 'operators' object, and pushes the result back onto the stack. If the token is a number, it pushes it onto the stack. When all tokens have been processed, the result is the last number left on the stack.

The TypeScript version uses the class-based object-oriented programming feature of TypeScript, which is not available in JavaScript. It also uses the type annotation feature of TypeScript to specify the types of variables and function return values, which helps catch type-related errors at compile time.

The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses a procedural approach. It reads an arithmetic expression from the console, finds the operator in the expression using a regular expression, splits the expression into operands, performs the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator, and prints the result. If the operator is division and the second operand is zero, it prints an error message and exits. 

The JavaScript version does not use any special language features or methods that are not available in TypeScript. It uses the readline module to read input from the console, which is a feature of Node.js, not JavaScript itself.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is more complex than the JavaScript version. It uses two stacks to store the values and operators separately. It also handles parentheses in the arithmetic expression, which the JavaScript version does not.

The C++ version uses the `isdigit` function to check if a character is a digit, and it uses a while loop to handle multi-digit numbers. It also uses the `-'0'` trick to convert a digit character to its corresponding integer value.

The C++ version uses the `precedence` function to determine the precedence of the operators. This allows it to handle expressions with different operator precedence correctly, which the JavaScript version does not.

The C++ version uses the `applyOp` function to apply an operator to two values. This is similar to the switch statement in the JavaScript version.

The C++ version does not check for division by zero, unlike the JavaScript version.

The C++ version uses `std::getline` to read the arithmetic expression from the console, which is similar to the `rl.question` method in the JavaScript version.

The C++ version uses `std::cout` to print the result, which is similar to the `console.log` function in the JavaScript version.

In summary, the C++ version is more complex and handles more cases than the JavaScript version, but it does not check for division by zero. The C++ version uses language features such as stacks and the `isdigit` function, which are not used in the JavaScript version.
